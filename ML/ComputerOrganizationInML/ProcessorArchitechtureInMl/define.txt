1. CPU (Central Processing Unit): 
>> CPU is the primary processing unit of a computer that executes program instructions, performs calculations, and controls all system operations.

Core:
>> A core is an individual processing unit of a CPU/GPU/TPU that can independently executes instructions.
>> logical way of Example: Think of cores as a workers
>> 1 core  = one worker doing one task at a time.
>> 4 cores = four workers are doing tasks simultaneously.
>> More cores = More work done in parallel

CPU works:
>> 1. Few cores (1-16 usually)
>> 2. very smart cores
>> 3. Handles tasks step by step

CPU Roles in Data science & ML:
>> Data cleaning (Pandas, NumPy)
>> Feature engineering
>> Small ML models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees)
>> Running Python code, loops, logic

2. GPU (Graphical Processing Unit):
>> GPU is a specialized processor designed to perform a large number of computations simultaneously making it ideal for parallel processing tasks.

GPU works:
>> 1. Thousands of cores
>> 2. Does many calculations at the same time.
>> 3. Perfect for matrix operations.

GPU Roles in Deep Learning & ML:
>> Training Neural Networks
>> CNNs (images)
>> RNNs / Transformers
>> TensorFlow, PyTorch models

3. TPU (Tensor Processing Unit):
>> TPU is a custom build hardware accelerator developed by google, specially optimized for Tensor operations in ML and Deep Learning workloads.

Tensor:
>> A tensor is just data in n-dimensions:

Name	Dimensions	Example
Scalar	0D	5
Vector	1D	[1, 2, 3]
Matrix	2D	[[1,2],[3,4]]
Tensor	3D+	Image, video, batches

TPU works:
>> Optimized for tensors (multi-dimensional arrays)
>> Extremely fast for deep learning
>> Works best with TensorFlow

Roles in Data science and ML:
>> Large-scale deep learning
>> Research & production models
>> Google Colab TPUs
