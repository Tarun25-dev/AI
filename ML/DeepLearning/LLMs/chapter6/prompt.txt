Prompt Engineering: 
>> Prompt Engineering is all about understand how to talk with LLMS effectively so you get better and accurate reaults.

Prompt:
>> A prompt is simply a instruction or question you give to an LLM.

Example:
>> Bad prompt : Explain AI
>> Good prompt: Explain AI in simple words for a final-year engineering student with examples.

Same question but different outputs
Better prompt = Better answers

Why prompt engineering matters?
Beacuse,
    >> LLMs only follow patterns in your text
    >> Ambiguous prompts → unclear answers
    >> Clear prompts → precise answers
