Prompt Tricks:
>> Prompt tricks are small adjustments in your prompt that make LLMs give better, accurate, and tailored responses.

1. Add content: Give the model extra information about your scenario.
>> Format : Explain [topic] using examples related to [context].
>> Example: Explain embeddings using examples from college projects.
>> LLM output → more relevant, Makes learning practical.

2. Specify Length: Tell the LLM how long the answer should be.
>> Format : Explain [topic] in [number] sentences / words / bullet points.
>> Example: Explain tokenization in 3 sentences.
>> Avoids long-winded explanations, Useful for notes or slides.

3. Specify Style / Tone: Tell the model how to speak
>> Format : Explain [topic] in a [style] tone.
>> Example: Explain embeddings in a friendly tone like you are talking to a friend.
            Explain LLMs in a professional tone for a report.
>> Style → casual, professional, funny, simple, Useful for blogs, emails, or presentations

4. Ask for Step-by-Step: Make the model reason or teach sequentially.
>> Format : Explain [topic] step by step.
>> Example: Explain how an LLM predicts the next word, step by step.
>> Makes output structured and clear, Easier to follow for beginners.

5. Asks for bullet points or Lists: Structure content for easy reading.
>> Format : Give [number] main points about [topic].
>> Example: Give 5 main points about attention in LLMs.
>> Helps in note-taking or documentation

6. Ask the LLM to Act as Someone: Assign a role or persona.
>> Format : You are a [role]. Explain [topic] to [audience].
>> Example: You are a senior AI engineer. Explain embeddings to a beginner student.
>> LLM adapts tone and complexity automatically

7. Combine Tricks: You can mix multiple tricks for maximum control.
>> Example: You are an AI tutor. Explain embeddings step by step in 3 bullet points using examples from college projects in a friendly tone.
>> Output → structured, relevant, easy-to-understand, Perfect for notes, learning, or mini-projects
