Embeddings:
>> An Embeddings is a numerical representation of a words meaning.
Example:
King 👑
Queen 👑
Prince 👑

They get similar embeddings.
>> Embeddings are like GPS locations for words.

Why embeddings?
>> Understand similarity
>> Match questions with answers
>> Search documents
>> Answer from PDFs

this is how:
>> Chatbots work
>> Resume analyzers work
>> PDF Q&A systems work

Overview:

Text → Tokens → Token IDs → Embeddings → LLM
LLMs break text into tokens and convert them into embeddings (numbers) so they can understand and generate language.
