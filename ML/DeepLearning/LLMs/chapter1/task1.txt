Prompt Engineering Exercise:

Open ChatGPT and type this:

"You are an AI tutor.
Teach me LLMs from zero in simple English.
Ask me small questions and correct me if I’m wrong."

I do that and the output shown in below

Lesson 1: What is AI? (Very basics)

First, let’s start before LLMs.

🤖 What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

AI means making a computer behave like a human in a small way.

Examples:

Google Maps suggesting the fastest route

YouTube recommending videos

ChatGPT answering your questions

The computer is not thinking like a human, but it is following patterns from data.

Lesson 2: What is Machine Learning (ML)?
🧠 Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a part of AI.

Instead of:

“If A happens, do B”

We say:

“Here is a lot of data. Learn patterns from it.”

Example:

Show the computer 1000 photos of cats

Tell it: “These are cats”

Later it can guess if a new photo is a cat

So:

AI → big idea

ML → learning from data

Lesson 3: What is a Model?

A model is like a brain file inside the computer.

It learns from data

It stores patterns

It gives answers

Example:

Calculator → fixed rules

ML model → learns rules by itself

🧪 Small Question (Answer in one line)

Q1:
What does Machine Learning mainly do?

A) Uses fixed rules written by humans
B) Learns patterns from data
C) Works only on the internet

Answer: B ML learns patterns from data.
