Difference Between Inference and Training:

| Training           | Inference           |
| ------------------ | ------------------- |
| Teaching the model | Using the model     |
| Very expensive     | Still costly        |
| Happens rarely     | Happens every query |
| Uses huge data     | Uses your prompt    |

Overview:
 >> Training teaches an LLM using huge data,
    while inference is using the trained model to generate answers, 
    and both require heavy computing power.
